# IPL-Project
I created a ipl project on web development and it is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have used these technologies to create the structure, style, and interactivity of my web application.  For data handling use local storage. This allows us to store data locally on the user's devices.  On the homepage shown a card-based grid of all the teams. On the team card click takes the user to the team details page. From the homepage, users can also search for players from different teams by entering a team code. The top bar have a button using which the users can add new teams and new players inside the local storage. When a new team/player is added, it will be visible on the screen as well.
